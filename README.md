Tips for exploring this repository:
1. Definitely explore the [puzzlesolver](puzzlesolver) in depth. There should be a README.md in every important directory to explain what each file does.
2. Understand what a [puzzle tree](https://nyc.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Puzzle_tree) is.
3. Create your own puzzle using [puzzle.py](puzzlesolver/puzzles/puzzle.py) and if you're ready, create your own puzzle solver using [solver.py](puzzlesolver/solver/solver.py)
4. [Hanoi.py](puzzlesolver/puzzles/Hanoi.py) and [GeneralSolver.py](puzzlesolver/solver/GeneralSolver.py) are two examples of a puzzle and a solver.
