# Packaging on PyPI
## Background
The Python Packaging Index (PyPI) is a collection of packages that users can install through `pip`. You probably encountered some of these packages before when you ran `pip install`

GamesmanPuzzles has its own package on PyPI. Here's how you can package it

### 1. Credentials
Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), then ask Anthony or Dan to allow you to get access to the GamesmanPuzzles project.

### 2. Follow the tutorial
Follow this [link](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-your-project) to learn how to package an example project. The guide's name is Packaging your Project if the link doesn't work

We recommend always using [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) when testing a package before publishing an official release.

### 3. Specific build instructions

__TODO: there are no specifics yet__

And that's it, you're done! Always make sure a build is passing before ever publishing
