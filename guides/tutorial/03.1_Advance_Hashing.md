# Advanced Hashing Techniques
_Note: this guide was made as a temporary change to 03_Solver_Methods.md. Someone can try to integrate it to the rest of tutorial in the future, but for now this is a small fix._

We can achieve better performance in our solvers if we try to limit the number of positions a solver has to traverse. This can be done by reducing positions that have the same remoteness value to the same hash value, but how can we determine that if we can't solve the puzzle beforehand? We can achieve this by observing __symmetries__ in the Puzzle and mapping those symmetries to a single hash value.

In Hanoi, the basic starting position looks like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

The fact that the starting position has all the disks on the left is arbitrary. It doesn't matter where the disks start as long as they are not on the rightmost rod. So, we can also visualize another possible starting position where all the disks are in the middle:

<p align="center">
<img src='assets/HanoiSym2.png' width=400>
</p>

Intuitively, these positions should have the same remoteness. Where the disks start on the first two rods shouldn't have any effect on the number of moves you need to make to get all the disks on the rightmost rod. In fact, this principle doesn't just apply to the starting positions, it applies to __all__ positions of Hanoi (we'll leave this as an exercise to the reader).

With this idea in mind, we can use a technique called __reindexing__ to reorder all symmetrical positions into a single number.

## Reindexing
The idea of this technique is to reorder the first two rods. This allows us to reduce the number of permutations into just a single combination. The choice of sorting algorithm to order the rods doesn't matter in this case, so let's reorder the rods based on the largest disk.
