# Puzzle and Solver Guide
This guide is meant for newcommers of the GamesmanPuzzles project to gain an intuition of how a Puzzle is solved by implementing the puzzle of Hanoi as well as the GeneralSolver. We'll first implement the Puzzle, and later implement the Solver. Start by looking at the [Puzzle prerequisites](00_Puzzle_Prerequisites.md).
