# Tests
This is where we would be testing our solvers on the games we develop. Ideally, there should be a test for every game and a solver should have at least one game to be tested on.
### Current tests
* TestHanoi.py: Our Hanoi test.
### If you want to test manually:
Go to the base directory and execute. You have to have pytest installed.
```
pytest puzzlesolver/test/[name_of_test.py]
```
