# Tests
This is where we would be testing our solvers on the games we develop. Ideally, there should be a test for every game and a solver should have at least one game to be tested on.
### Current tests
* test_Hanoi.py: Basic Hanoi test.
* test_PickleWrapper.py: Test for the PickleWrapperSolver
* test_PuzzleTutorial.py: Test for the puzzle tutorial
* test_SolverTutorial.py: Test for the solver tutorial
* test_GeneralSolver.py: Test for GeneralSolver
* test_GraphPuzzle.py: Test for GraphPuzzle
### If you want to test manually:
Go to the base directory and execute. You have to have pytest installed.
```
pytest
```
